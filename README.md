Madison College PHP Spring 2020 final project.

This application was created for my PHP final project, utilizing PhpMyAdmin and demonstrating the flexibility and range that PHP has for web performance. This app hosts a dice-based game in which the player competes against the computer, swapping randomly determined attack and defense rolls in each head-to-head combat. This app also allows for account creation to store win/loss percentage and ranks players on a leaderboard, with game data stored in a database. This package includes data for several example players. Uploaded for portfolio viewing.
