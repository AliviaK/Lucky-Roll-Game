This application was created for my PHP final project, demonstrating the flexibility and range that PHP has for web performance. This app hosts a dice-based game in which the player competes against the computer, swapping randomly determined attack and defense rolls in each head-to-head combat. This app also allows for account creation to store win/loss percentage and ranks players on a leaderboard, with game data stored in a database. This package includes data for several example players.
